# ü¶∑ RestorativeAI: A Multimodal AI System for Diagnostic Support in Dentistry

This repository contains the codebase and resources for the thesis project titled **"A Multimodal AI System for Diagnostic Support and Treatment Planning in Restorative Dentistry"**. The system combines radiographic imaging (OPGs, CTs) and clinical notes to build AI-driven diagnostic and planning tools.

## üîç Project Overview

- **Modality 1**: Panoramic X-rays (OPGs)
- **Modality 2**: Cone-beam CT Scans (CBCTs)
- **Modality 3**: Clinical Diagnosis & Metadata
- **Goal**: Segment dental structures, classify conditions (e.g., implant need, crown viability), and assist with treatment planning.
